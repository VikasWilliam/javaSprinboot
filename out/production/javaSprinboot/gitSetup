The error you're encountering indicates that Git is unable to authenticate using the SSH key, which is used for secure communication with GitHub. This can happen due to several reasons such as missing or incorrect SSH keys, or misconfigured access rights.

Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

1. Ensure that you have an SSH key set up:
You need to have an SSH key generated and added to your GitHub account.
Steps to generate a new SSH key (if you don’t have one):
Open your terminal and run the following command to generate a new SSH key:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
When prompted, press Enter to accept the default location for saving the SSH key (/Users/your_user/.ssh/id_rsa).

If you are prompted for a passphrase, you can either enter a passphrase for added security or leave it empty by pressing Enter.

Once the key is generated, you can view the public key using:

bash
Copy
Edit
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the entire output of the command.

Add your SSH key to GitHub:
Go to GitHub and log into your account.
In the upper-right corner, click your profile picture, then go to Settings.
In the sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key, give it a title (e.g., "My MacBook SSH Key"), and paste the copied SSH key into the key field.
Click Add SSH Key to save it.
2. Ensure your SSH agent is running:
Start the SSH agent in the background:

bash
Copy
Edit
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Add your SSH key to the agent:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
3. Test SSH connection to GitHub:
Verify that your SSH key is correctly configured by testing the connection:

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh -T git@github.com
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Hi your_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
4. Use HTTPS as an alternative:
If you don’t want to deal with SSH keys, you can clone the repository using HTTPS instead of SSH:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/VikasWilliam/javaSprinboot.git
You will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token, if two-factor authentication is enabled).

After following these steps, you should be able to clone the repository successfully.
